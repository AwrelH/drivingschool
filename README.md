## Features

On each page you have a welcome title, a navigation bar, location information and a footer. Furthermore, on each page you have a main content area between the navigation bar and the map area. The view width is 1200px and centered on larger screens.


### Navigation

The navigation bar is centered with space between each page-link across the screen on devices that are bigger than 650px, below that the links will stack up on each other. 

**DrivingSchool**- is the first page, the homepage.     
**Our Offers** - is the page where you can read on the offers that are available.   
**Good to know** - is general/official information regarding getting a license in Sweden.  
**Contact Us** - is where you can contact the school and take it to the next stage. 

Style wise the font-size is a bit larger for an easy layout and accessibility. 

### map area and footer
These are located in the bottom of each page. The point is to repeat the school's location and social media presence to potential costumer. Location is fictive, and the social media symbols will only take you their official homepages. 

## Colours

The colours that appear in this home page are following:
**bisque**, **#91E0C6**, **#F1F3F4**, **#FFB027** and **white** since the max-width is 1200px on larger screens and the content is not stretching 100%.
